          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <div class="bio-info"><p>In 2010, I was a public school 5th grade teacher when my first child was born. My little Hazel struggled with me working outside of the house. When she was 6 months old, I resigned to stay home with her. Hazelbee Baby, the shop, was born!</p><br><p>I personally designed, drafted, tested, and sewed thousands of these dresses over the 5 years that the shop was open. After my third child was born, I was no longer able to keep up with my sewing business. I had my patterns drafted into PDF files and hosted them here on Etsy! Every couple of years I take the time to update my pattern files and add new features.</p><br><p> I am so proud of my little small business and hope you love sewing these dresses as much as I did!</p></div>
